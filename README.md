#### TODO

- `sync`
    - locals not in remote are pushed
- `list` command:
    - sync first
    - sort by latest modified first
- add `rename` command:
  - change name of a file locally/remotely
- add `archive` command:
  - tags a file as "archived"
  - "archived" files don't show on `list` by default
  - add option to `list` to show "archived" files
